            <p class="pink">In the essay 'Black Barbie and the Deep Play of Difference,' Ann Ducille narrates the time she saw a black teenage girl scanning the Barbie isle of Toys R Us. The girl described the stream of multilations and murders she did to her Barbie doll over the years. Empathetically, she said, “It’s the hair….The hair, that hair; I want it. I want it!”

            <p class="pink">Throughout the ages, women’s hair has been viewed as their ‘crowning glory.’ In the book Hair Stories Rohina Hoffman writes, “Hair is a construct reflecting our identity, history, femininity, personality, and our innermost feelings of self-doubt, ageing, vanity and self-esteem.” With the blonde picture of Barbie being plastered on every merchandise and promotional item, this effect on ‘self-esteem’ described by Hoffman gets easier to creep in. The lack of hair types and with names of hair like “Va-Va-Violet” in the Barbie line, it gets harder to for girls with more ‘ethnic hair’ to view themselves through their childhood idols, which also creates this sentiment of ‘otherness.’

            <p>In Lisa Jones’ book Bulletproof Diva, she described how she first cut off all her hair of her Barbie dolls and then dressed them in African prints because there weren’t many black Barbie options. But she after she realized that all the girls at her school looked like Barbie, she proceeded to behead and dissassemble all her dolls.

            <p>In an advertisement for Hong Kong-based clothier line, they featured a laboriously manipulated photo of a model whose skin was altered uncannily "to resemble the plastic sheen and light skin tone of a racially white Barbie doll." Her face was redrawn to vividly match the doll's 'wide-eyed smiling expression' while she poses in front of a vibrant pink background with an assortment of accessories.

            <p class="black">In the same essay previously mentioned by Ann Ducille, she argues that race and racial differences are reducible to factors such as 'skin color,' or in Barbie's case, "the tint of the plastic poured into each Barbie’s mold.” Barbie has repeatedly found herself subjected to criticism because even though Mattel has released 'diverse dolls,' they still use the same mold of the original doll and just tint the skin tone. This can also be extended to the lack of facial differences between the standard Barbie dolls and the ethnic dolls. Ducille feels by ignoring this important distinctions, they are ignoring the ‘body politics of real people’ and creates this feeling of ‘tone-deafness.’ With Barbie’s facial features matching only a very limited audience, they are setting this very niche way of looking as the ‘new normal,’ which further promotes this feeling of an outsider or ‘otherness.’ We are inherently limiting the perspective through which young girls could perceive themselves and those surrounding them in multitude.

It’s like if you’re bigger, you have to wear a sack. But she doesn’t look like that.” In the same interview, another mom offers, “There are shapes that are curvier and still are beautiful….I wish that she were curvier”

            <p class="pink">In an article from BBC News, Claire Bates measures the 2016 curvy Barbie in comparison to the proportions of an average British woman. She found  that if curvy Barbie was a real woman, her waist would be 9 more centimeters bigger, and her hips would be 13.2 centimeters larger than the original. She also noticed that the head of the curvy Barbie is exactly the same size as the head of the original Barbie. Bates concludes that curvy Barbie can't be considered plus-sized, as a matter of fact, her proportions are particularly thinner than an average British woman.

            <p class="pink">Feminist writer Mary Dorsey Wanley believed that Barbie echoed that "the mind, heart, and soul of a woman are subordinate to the body - personalities don’t count - thinness is everything.” This ‘thinness’ is argued to reflect on the prior mentioned ‘self-esteem’ issues and is culpable in creating eating disorders from a very young age. A research done by Anschutz and Engels proves that girls who played with Barbie ate less food in comparison to girls who played with an average-sized doll (in this case an Emme doll). In Anschutz's and Engels's eyes, the girls were "inspired by the Barbie to achieve a slim body." This also breeds into the culture of ‘fat-phobia’ and psychologically creates an unhealthy relationship between girls and their bodies. With Barbie being such an ‘influential icon’ of everyone’s childhood and setting extremely unrealistic beauty standards, how can we be sure that children aren’t projecting the exact same restrictions on themselves? And with this distorted lens provided to children to view the world around them and themselves, how can we be sure that they won't get lost?</p>

            <p class="bold"> M.J. Lord, author of Forever Barbie writes, “People project wildly dissimilar and opposing fantasies on her … [And] she is a universally recognized image but what she represents is entirely personal.” Since we associate such a deep personal meaning to Barbie, it’s no wonder we look back at her when we reflect on our childhoods and she continues to influence us later on in our lives too. However, this connection stretches beyond Barbie play. Whether you played with Lottie dolls or Polly Pockets, as seen through the lens of Barbie, the impractical figures and facial structures of these dolls poses a great threat to long lasting impressions it leaves on young girls, and by ignoring the body politics of the doll industry, we are just further validating these false perceptions girls develop at an early age. With toys affirming the reality around us, it becomes extremely critical to microfocus our attention to subtle details and the implications it has on children’s relationships with themselves and others. After all, we can either let girls continue to be Barbie’s friend, or let them finally get their spotlight and be Barbie.
